            <h1>The True Cost of Screen Size: Process Behind the Pixel</h1>
            <p>
                Imagine standing in the aisle of a massive electronics store. Wall-to-wall screens flicker with vibrant
                colors, each vying for your attention.
                For the average Australian homeowner, this choice is often paralyzed by technical jargon: 4K, 8K, OLED,
                QLED.
                But beyond the glossy marketing, a silent cost accumulates in every frame: <strong>power
                    consumption</strong>.
                Our deep dive into the 2026 television market peels back the showroom sticker to reveal the real price
                of your "home cinema."
            </p>

            <h2>The Paradox of Choice: Giants Efficiency Market</h2>
            <p>
                First, we mapped the market landscape. Who actually owns the shelf space?
                We analyzed hundreds of models available in retailers across the country to see which manufacturers are
                flooding the market.
            </p>
            <figure>

                    alt="Bar chart showing the number of unique TV models for each brand"
                    style="max-width: 60%; height: auto;">
                <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Unique model count per brand. The market is not evenly
                    distributed.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                As Figure 1 reveals, the market is top-heavy. Industry titans like <strong>Samsung</strong>,
                <strong>Blaupunkt</strong>, and <strong>Ark</strong>
                dominate the landscape with a staggering array of options.
                Samsung alone offers a model for nearly every niche—from compact bedroom units to wall-spanning
                behemoths.
                While this variety offers consumers unprecedented choice, it creates a potential trap:
                <em>more models mean more variability in efficiency.</em>
                Two TVs from the same brand, sitting side-by-side, might look identical but consume vastly different
                amounts of power depending on their unseen internal tech.
            </p>

            <h2>The Energy Penalty of "Going Big"</h2>
            <p>
                Once you've navigated the brand maze, the next question is size.
                The trend is undeniable: we want bigger screens. But physics exacts a toll for every extra inch of
                immersion.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/screen%20size%20n%20mode%20power.png"
                    alt="Scatter plot showing the relationship between screen size and power consumption"
                    style="max-width: 60%; height: auto;">
                <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Power consumption vs. Screen Size. Notice the steep climb as
                    screens exceed 65 inches.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Figure 2 visualizes this "Energy Penalty." As you move along the X-axis from reasonable 40-inch screens
                to the grand 85-inch displays, power consumption doesn't just creep up—it jumps.
                However, look closer at the scatter plot. Notice the vertical spread at specific sizes (like the 65-inch
                mark)?
                That gap represents <strong>opportunity</strong>.
                It proves that a massive screen <em>doesn't have to be</em> a power hog.
                By choosing advanced, efficient display panels (often found in newer OLED or Micro-LED ranges), smart
                shoppers can have their massive screen without the massive bill.
            </p>

            <h2>Technology Matters: Not All Pixels Are Created Equal</h2>
            <p>
                Size isn't the only factor. The underlying technology powering your pixels plays a massive role in your
                quarterly bill.
                We compared the power consumption modes of different screen technologies to see which ones are the most
                efficient.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/screen%20tech%20n%20mode%20power.png"
                    alt="Multi-line chart comparing power consumption of different TV technologies"
                    style="max-width: 60%; height: auto;">
                <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Screen Technology vs. Power Consumption. Different display types
                    exhibit vastly different energy profiles.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                As seen in Figure 3, the choices you make between LED, OLED, and other display types have distinct
                energy footprints.
                Some technologies sip power while others guzzle it, especially at higher brightness settings.
                Understanding these curves allows you to balance visual fidelity with energy efficiency.
            </p>

            <h2>The Final Verdict</h2>
            <p>
                The data tells a clear story: the "sticker price" is only the deposit. The real cost of ownership is
                hidden in wattage.
                Don't just buy the biggest screen that fits your wall. Look for the efficient outliers within those
                dominant brands.
                Your electricity bill—and the planet—will thank you for looking beyond the pixels.
